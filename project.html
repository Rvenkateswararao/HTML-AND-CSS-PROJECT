                <h1>Eye surgery</h1>
                <p>Eye surgery, also known as ophthalmic surgery or ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa.[1] Eye surgery is part of ophthalmology
                     and is performed by an ophthalmologist or eye surgeon. The eye is a fragile organ, and requires due care before, during, and after a surgical procedure to minimize or prevent further damage. An eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the
                      necessary safety precautions.</p>

                <h1>Brain Surgery</h1>
                <p>Brain surgery is used to treat a variety of conditions, such as tumors, blood clots, aneurysms, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. It is performed by a neurosurgeon and involves an anesthesiologist with extensive knowledge of the types of anesthesia, monitoring, and post-operative care required for these sensitive operations. In some cases, this anesthesiologist will be a neuroanesthesiologist who has received advanced clinical training in anesthesia for brain and spinal surgeries.</p>

                <h1>Heart Surgery</h1>
                <p>Heart-related problems do not always require surgery. Sometimes they can be addressed with lifestyle changes, medications, or nonsurgical procedures. For example, catheter ablation uses energy to make small scars in your heart tissue to prevent abnormal electrical signals from moving through your heart. Coronary angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure in which a stent is inserted into a narrowed or blocked coronary artery to hold it open.</p>
